## Groupie Tracker Search Bar

### Objectives

This project aims to create a functional search bar within the Groupie Tracker website that allows users to search for specific information related to artists, bands, members, locations, first album dates, and creation dates. The search bar should:

- Handle case-insensitive search inputs.
- Provide typing suggestions as the user types.
- Identify and display the individual type of each search suggestion (e.g., "Freddie Mercury" -> member).

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Search Cases:**
   - Implement search functionality for the following categories:
     - Artist/band name
     - Members
     - Locations
     - First album date
     - Creation date


2. **Typing Suggestions:**
   - Implement a mechanism to provide real-time typing suggestions as the user enters text in the search bar.
   - Suggestions should be relevant to the search query and displayed in a user-friendly manner.

4. **Suggestion Type Identification:**
   - Clearly indicate the type of each suggestion (artist, band, member, location, etc.) to help users refine their search.

5. **Display Format:**
   - Display suggestions in a format that is easy to read and understand. Consider using a consistent format for suggestions, such as:
     - **Name** - Type (e.g., "Phil Collins" - member)

### Additional Considerations

- **Search Algorithm:** Choose an efficient search algorithm (e.g., full-text search, fuzzy matching) that can handle large datasets and provide accurate results.
- **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as empty search queries or database errors.
- **Performance:** Optimize the search functionality to ensure it performs well, even with large datasets.
